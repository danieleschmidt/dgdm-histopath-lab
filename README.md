# dgdm-histopath-lab
The dgdm-histopath-lab implements state-of-the-art Dynamic Graph Diffusion Models (DGDM) for analyzing gigapixel whole-slide images (WSI) in digital pathology. This end-to-end pipeline leverages self-supervised entity masking and hierarchical graph representations to outperform traditional CNN baselines on AAAI-25 benchmarks.
